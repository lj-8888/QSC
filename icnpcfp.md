NTN (Non-Terrestrial Network) integration is an ambitious mission from 3GPP to extend the Internet to sky and space. Currently it has been widely accepted as a major block for 6G. One of the goals of 6G is to enable large-scale LEO (Low Earth Orbit) satellite constellations to form different moving networks and be integrated with the Internet. In the future, the LEO satellite network will become part of the Internet and can be used for 5G/6G wireless access and back-haul network for wireless service providers, and transport network for terrestrial service providers. 

However, LEO satellite constellation also raises technical challenges due to its unprecedented moving velocity (>7 km/s) and the scalability of the network (over 10k satellites plus millions of ground stations). Various challenges need to be addressed, spanning multiple areas such as direct cellphone-to-satellite connectivity, wireless access architecture utilizing gNB on LEO satellites, power management and antenna technology for both end-user devices and satellites, IP-capable satellite and large-scale satellite network, free space optical communication for inter-satellite-link (ISL), tracking technology for ISL and ground-station, and more.

On the other hand, 6G intends to shift the conventional symbol-based communication systems that are nearing the Shannon capacity limit to Qualitative and Semantic Communications. They share the same principle: the intended to be transmitted by the sender does not need to be match bit-by-bit to the received. Qualitative Communication enables the receiver to consume some portion of the packet or modified version of the packet in a timely manner. Similarly, Semantic Communication focuses on the significance of transmitted symbols or bits. In this paradigm, a transmission that involves distorted symbols does not necessarily indicate semantic errors, and the receiver can still comprehend the intended meaning. 

These new paradigms aim to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of communication systems to support the demanding applications of 6G. To fully realize the potential of these emerging communication paradigms, further research and development are required. This includes a meticulous redesign of network architecture, network protocols, information encoding, processing, decoding, packet transmission, routing, and other related components.

This workshop aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, and industry experts to present and discuss recent advancements and future directions for 6G enablers: Satellite, Qualitative and Semantic Communications. Topics of interest for this workshop include, but are not limited to:
